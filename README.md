## Introduction
A small Python project created to simulate interaction with an ATM machine, with the ability to choose your name and current balance.

You get a choice to insert your card and to withdraw a custom amount of money from your desired balance.

Point of this project is to give an example of object orianted programing with classes and inheritence.

## Installation
This project does not require any downloadable libraries so you can just clone the project using:
